# PROGRESS.md — build log

The running log of how this project was built and evolved.
The agent appends an entry at the start and end of each phase (see `blueprint.md` §13).
Spec _changes_ go in the blueprint's Amendment log (§15); _build activity_ goes here.
Keep entries factual and terse.

## Log

### (seed) — Phase 0 not yet started

- Repo contains the ready-to-go scaffolding (blueprint, CLAUDE, README, .gitignore,
  .env.example, sync.config.example.json, this file).
  Agent begins at Phase 0 per `blueprint.md` §13.

### 2026-06-03 — Pivot: CLI bidirectional sync → local web UI for one-time Operations

- Human-directed scope change before any code was written.
  Authored as `blueprint.md` §15 amendment of the same date; rewrote §1, §3, §8, §9, §10,
  §11, §13, §14 to match.
- Tool's unit of work is now the **Operation**:
  `{source, destination, sourceTarget, destinationTarget}`, additive-only, run on-demand
  from the UI's Run button with live SSE status. The Spotify ↔ Apple bidirectional
  reconciliation model with `sync_pairs`/`baseline` three-way merge is deferred.
- Removed `sync.config.example.json` (operations are ad-hoc; pair config no longer exists).
  Removed `reports/` from `.gitignore` (no reports directory in v1; unmatched surfaces in
  the UI and in `operation_events`).
- Repo state heading into Phase 0: `blueprint.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` (needs update
  for new UI surface — pending in Phase 0), `PROGRESS.md`, `.gitignore`, `.env`, and
  `.env.example` (still TBD — Phase 0). No source code yet.
- Next: Phase 0 scaffold per the revised §13.

### 2026-06-03 — Spec amendment: Permissions preflight gate

- Human-directed addition before any code was written.
  Authored as `blueprint.md` §15 amendment of the same date; updated §1 in-scope bullet,
  §3 (added `src/preflight/`), §9 (added `preflight_runs` + `preflight_checks` tables),
  §11 (added Permissions panel + endpoints + gating policy + `doctor` sharing the
  orchestrator), §13 (inserted new Phase 5; renumbered the rest), and §14.
- Behavior: 11-check sequence (env, both tokens, Spotify scopes, sample reads on each side,
  ISRC lookup, Apple delete-probe). Streams pass/warn/fail via SSE.
  Catalog refresh + Operation runs are disabled UI-side and 412-refused server-side until
  the latest preflight `passed`. Auto-invalidation on any downstream 401/403.
  No time-window expiry — re-check is cheap.
- The CLI `doctor` is now a thin surface over the same `preflight/runner.ts`;
  a CLI pass and a UI pass are interchangeable for gating.
- Phase plan grew from 8 → 9 phases.
  Phase 5 is now Permissions preflight; Catalog/UI is 6; Operation runner is 7;
  Polish is 8; Publish is 9.
- Next: still Phase 0 scaffold (no code yet); the preflight work lands in the new Phase 5.

### 2026-06-03 — Spec amendment: Preflight design tightened (validation pass)

- Human asked to deeply validate and resolve five open concerns I had raised against the
  previous preflight amendment, then commit and push.
  Authored as `blueprint.md` §15 amendment of the same date; updated §1, §6.2, §9, §11.1,
  §13 (Phase 5 AC rewritten), and §14.
- Resolutions:
  1. **Gate has a 24h soft expiry** in addition to the failure-based invalidation.
     Catches overnight drift (revoked Spotify auth, expired MUT) at the door rather than
     mid-Operation. Re-checks are cheap.
  2. **`apple_delete_probe` removed from v1 preflight.**
     v1 deletes nothing, so the probe is deferred along with removals;
     §6.2 now states this explicitly. Check list is 10, not 11.
  3. **Auto-invalidation is refresh-aware.**
     `util/http.ts` attempts one token refresh / dev-token re-sign + retry on 401;
     only the second 401 (or a 403 whose body indicates a scope problem, not rate-limit)
     writes an `invalidated` row.
     Trigger values: `'auto-401'` or `'auto-403-scope'`.
     Rate-limit 403s and transient 401s recovered by refresh do not invalidate.
  4. **`spotify_scopes` reads the persisted scope list from `data/tokens.json`**
     (captured from the OAuth `scope` response field).
     Spotify has no public token-introspection endpoint for PKCE clients —
     inventing one would violate the truthfulness invariant.
     The blueprint now calls this out so a future agent doesn't go hunting.
  5. **Ten checks remain fine-grained, presented in three UI groups**
     (Environment / Spotify / Apple).
     Env runs first; Spotify and Apple groups run in parallel;
     intra-group skips when a prerequisite fails.
- Phase plan unchanged (still 9 phases).
  Phase 5 AC rewritten as six numbered subcriteria so the agent has concrete pass/fail
  targets (e.g. "backdate `finished_at` to >24h → gate closes →
  POST /api/catalog/refresh returns 412").
- Next: Phase 0 scaffold per §13. After this docs commit lands, building begins.
